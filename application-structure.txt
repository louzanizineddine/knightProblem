    ==> with JavaScript we generate the board.
    ==> for every cell has an id describing the rank and the file
    ==> every rank has a number from 1 to n
    ==> every file has a letter from a to the n letter
    ==> for simplicity we take n = 8 
    ==> we take as input the location of the knight 
    ==> we take as a seconf input the destination where the knight wants to go
